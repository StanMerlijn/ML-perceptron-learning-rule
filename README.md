# ML-Perceptron-learning-rule

## Student

Student nummer: 1863967

## Introduction
In this repository, we will implement and test a perceptron using the learning rule. This will be demonstrated by creating AND and XOR gates and by evaluating the perceptronâ€™s ability to classify the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html). The performance will be measured using the [MSE](src/header/MSE.hpp) metric. You can find the assignment [here](https://canvas.hu.nl/courses/44675/assignments/343529).
